# deep-learning-challenge

 This project applies deep learning using TensorFlow to predict whether organizations funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful. The model uses historical application data with various categorical and numeric features to classify success outcomes.
 
 ## Files
 
 - `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb`: Base model notebook

 - `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`: Saved HDF5 model
 - `AlphabetSoup_Report.md`: Full analysis report
 
 ## Technologies Used
 
 - Python
 - TensorFlow / Keras
 - Pandas
 - scikit-learn
 - Google Colab
 
 ## Key Steps
 
 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 - Categorical Encoding
 - Feature Engineering
 - Neural Network Design and Optimization
 - Model Evaluation
 
 ## Goal
 
 Achieve predictive accuracy of **75% or higher** using deep learning. If not achieved, apply multiple optimization strategies to improve performance.
